Currently exports stl, runs cura in bg, cura exports gcode. 

install as blender addon, enable, instal cura, show the addon path to the cura executable, hit print - it exports gcode to the place where is your file, uses selected objects for the export.

some properties are visible and can be tuned, but many more can be accessed. 
Similar to cura, I recommend having 2 options - begginer who choses quality of the print, and expert who can tune the variables. 
First we can do expert for tuning, later we can make the beginner presets for ppl who don't actually want to mess with tuning(everybody, if it works..). 

here is good inspiration for what can be tuned in cura:
